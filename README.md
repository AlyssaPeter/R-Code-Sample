#### This repository is intended to provide a sample of my technical work while allowing me to learn the methodologies of following **FAIR** guiding principles for scientific data management and stewardship. This is an ongoing project and personal endeavor.

The existing framework in which data and scientific knowledge are collected, shared, and re-used can be inefficient and impede further knowledge discovery and integration. Organizations that collect data should aim to have data management and stewardship plans that facilitate the dissemination and reuse of their data by downstream entities.

This project uses public data collected by the Water Quality Program of Thurston County from Black Lake.


**Included in the repository are:**

* The raw dataset

* A markdown file created with RStudio performing the QA assessment on the raw dataset and some preliminary analyses

* Inputs for dashboard development

* A dashboard developed in R using flexdashboard presenting results with a user-friendly interface (currently in development)
